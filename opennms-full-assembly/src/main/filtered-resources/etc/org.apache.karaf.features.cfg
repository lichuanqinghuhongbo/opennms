#
# Service requirements enforcement
#
# By default, the feature resolver checks the service requirements/capabilities of
# bundles for new features (xml schema >= 1.3.0) in order to automatically installs
# the required bundles.
# The following flag can have those values:
#   - disable: service requirements are completely ignored
#   - default: service requirements are ignored for old features
#   - enforce: service requirements are always verified
#
# OPENNMS: We need to disable this so that Pax Web doesn't complain about bring run
# inside our Felix bridge HTTP service (which does not implement the Pax Web services)
serviceRequirements=disable
